## Introduction
This repo holds the code for Chris Kuzma's [project submission](https://www.hackster.io/kuzma/solar-viability-tester-6cb5f1) for the [Realtime AT&T IoT StarterKit challenge](https://www.hackster.io/contests/RealtimeAT&TIoTStarterKit) contest hosted by [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/) and [AT&T](https://www.att.com/). The goal of the project is to build a wireless, self-powered and contained, cloud-enabled test for determining the viability of a permanent solar cell array installation for a given site.
